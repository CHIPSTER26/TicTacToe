Hi All, this is a game of Tic tac toe that i built using Street Fighter Theme, i hope you will enjoy it

## How it was built 

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this game. Work from 10PM-2AM not enough sleep.


## How to play 
Decided if you wish to turn on background music or not, like all street fighter arcade game, it has music.
background music start at 10% so you can always bump it up if you want it louder.
Take your time 3-4 seconds everytime you place the marks to enjoy getting kicked from the sound.
Once game ended wait for 3-4 second to hear music theme, wording and final quote.
Enjoy it slowly to hear all the effect.

## Planning
I did some googling and found many types of solution for tic tac toe as you would expect, i did code along with the youtuber to get a feeling how they think.
I did it many times, and also hear what they are saying about what's these code do, what's that code do, why they've choosen these path, etc. Learn other technic
such as CSS variable, array destructoring, and CSS animation and transition, I also look at MDN for sounds and sound control, volume start at 10%

## Known Bugs
Last bug i fixed when it turn out that playing music at start is not supported by browser, so we need to put button to start the sound.
Also copy startgame function and make another name called restartgame to fix it. I am will be adding more features and will encounter bugs for sure.


## Future features (Or you can call this Wishlist)
- Play with AI
- Networked multiplayer
- make more effect, when the player mark the cell, the other player picture get shaken or the face changed to get hit.
- applying random math into the type of sounds, make winning message apply to the winner rather than using generic kicking girl.

## My experience developing the game.
I learn lots of things to make it work, doing lots of youtubing which i never did prior to this project.
